              <p>Come join us for a hands-on planting session & myth-busters-esque Q&A for how to jumpstart a houseplant garden at home! We'll chat about exotic tropical plants/orchids/large houseplants and how to keep them alive over Boston winters and less-than-bright lab spaces :) If you want to learn how to take care about the air plant you received in your materials kit, this is the session for you!</p>
